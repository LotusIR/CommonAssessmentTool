Project -- Feature Development Backend: Create CRUD API's for Client

User Story

As a user of the backend API's, I want to call API's that can retrieve, update, and delete information of clients who have already registered with the CaseManagment service so that I more efficiently help previous clients make better decisions on how to be gainfully employed.

Acceptance Criteria
- Provide REST API endpoints so that the Frontend can use them to get information on an existing client.
- Document how to use the REST API
- Choose and create a database to hold client information
- Add tests


This will contain the model used for the project that based on the input information will give the social workers the clients baseline level of success and what their success will be after certain interventions.

The model works off of dummy data of several combinations of clients alongside the interventions chosen for them as well as their success rate at finding a job afterward. The model will be updated by the case workers by inputing new data for clients with their updated outcome information, and it can be updated on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

This also has an API file to interact with the front end, and logic in order to process the interventions coming from the front end. This includes functions to clean data, create a matrix of all possible combinations in order to get the ones with the highest increase of success, and output the results in a way the front end can interact with.

-------------------------How to Use-------------------------
1. In the virtual environment you've created for this project, install all dependencies in requirements.txt (pip install -r requirements.txt)

2. Run the app (uvicorn app.main:app --reload)

3. Load data into database (python initialize_data.py)

4. Go to SwaggerUI (http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

4. Log in as admin (username: admin password: admin123)

5. Click on each endpoint to use
-Create User (Only users in admin role can create new users. The role field needs to be either "admin" or "case_worker")

-Get clients (Display all the clients that are in the database)

-Get client (Allow authorized users to search for a client by id. If the id is not in database, an error message will show.)

-Update client (Allow authorized users to update a client's basic info by inputting in client_id and providing updated values.)

-Delete client (Allow authorized users to delete a client by id. If an id is no longer in the database, an error message will show.)

-Get clients by criteria (Allow authorized users to get a list of clients who meet a certain combination of criteria.)

-Get Clients by services (Allow authorized users to get a list of clients who meet a certain combination of service statuses.)

-Get clients services (Allow authorized users to view a client's services' status.)

-Get clients by success rate (Allow authorized users to search for clients whose cases have a success rate beyond a certain number.)

-Get clients by case worker (Allow users to view which clients are assigned to a specific case worker.)

-Update client services (Allow users to update the service status of a case.)

-Create case assignment (Allow authorized users to create a new case assignment.) -->

### User Story

### Acceptance Criteria

## Overview

This will contain the model used for the project that based on the input information will give the social workers the clients baseline level of success and what their success will be after certain interventions.

The model works off of dummy data of several combinations of clients alongside the interventions chosen for them as well as their success rate at finding a job afterward. The model will be updated by the case workers by inputing new data for clients with their updated outcome information, and it can be updated on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

This also has an API file to interact with the front end, and logic in order to process the interventions coming from the front end. This includes functions to clean data, create a matrix of all possible combinations in order to get the ones with the highest increase of success, and output the results in a way the front end can interact with.

## Local Deployment

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

4. Load initial data:

   ```bash
   python initialize_data.py
   ```

5. Open your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) to access Swagger UI.

6. Log in as admin:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`

7. Available Endpoints:

- Create User (Only users in admin role can create new users. The role field needs to be either "admin" or "case_worker")

- Get clients (Display all the clients that are in the database)

- Get client (Allow authorized users to search for a client by id. If the id is not in database, an error message will show.)

- Update client (Allow authorized users to update a client's basic info by inputting in client_id and providing updated values.)

- Delete client (Allow authorized users to delete a client by id. If an id is no longer in the database, an error message will show.)

- Get clients by criteria (Allow authorized users to get a list of clients who meet a certain combination of criteria.)

- Get Clients by services (Allow authorized users to get a list of clients who meet a certain combination of service statuses.)

- Get clients services (Allow authorized users to view a client's services' status.)

- Get clients by success rate (Allow authorized users to search for clients whose cases have a success rate beyond a certain number.)

- Get clients by case worker (Allow users to view which clients are assigned to a specific case worker.)

- Update client services (Allow users to update the service status of a case.)

- Create case assignment (Allow authorized users to create a new case assignment.)

## Public URL (AWS Deployment)

We've deployed to AWS, access Swagger UI at:


[Public URL](http://ec2-3-141-168-148.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/docs)


Use this interactive interface to test endpoints and explore the API functionality. (the same as local deployment)

## Running with Docker

Follow the steps below to build and run the backend application using Docker.

### 1. Build the Docker Image

Open terminal in the project root (where the `Dockerfile` is located), and run:

```bash
docker build -t common-assessment-tool:v1 .
```

This command builds the Docker image and tags it as `common-assessment-tool:v1`.

---

### 2. Run the Docker Container

To run the application in a container and expose it on port `8000`, use:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name app-container common-assessment-tool:v1
```

- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p 8000:8000`: Maps port 8000 inside the container to port 8000 on your host.
- `--name app-container`: Names the container for easy reference.

---

### 3. Manage the Container

To stop the container:

```bash
docker stop app-container
```

To start it again:

```bash
docker start app-container
```

To view the logs:

```bash
docker logs app-container
```

---

## Alternative: Running with Docker Compose

This project also supports Docker Compose, which is a convenient tool that acts as a wrapper around standard Docker commands. It simplifies managing containers by allowing you to start, stop, and restart services with a single command.

### 4. Using `docker-compose.yml`

The project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file for easier setup and execution. To use it:

1. Make sure Docker Compose is installed.
2. In the project root directory, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This command builds (if needed) and starts the container in detached mode.

To stop the container:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To restart:

```bash
docker compose restart
```

> Docker Compose automatically uses the configurations defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

---


## Notes

- Be sure to stop the container when you're done to free up system resources.
- The container exposes port `8000`, so avoid conflicts with other services on that port.
